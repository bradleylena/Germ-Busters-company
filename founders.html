      <h1>Founding Story</h1>
      <p>
        Founding Story Germ Busters was born from a simple yet powerful idea:
        that everyone deserves a clean, healthy space without the stress of
        doing it themselves. In the early days, Bradley Lenaiyarra started the
        company with just a few tools, a strong work ethic, and a commitment to
        quality service. As word spread about the care and consistency of his
        work, Germ Busters quickly grew into a trusted name in residential and
        commercial cleaning. Today, we proudly serve a wide range of clients
        while staying true to the principles we were founded on.
